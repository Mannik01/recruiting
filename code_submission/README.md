Project FYIs:

    Entry function name is "getOptimalCrew" that is present in optimal_crew.js file.
    If we do "yarn start" on the root folder, we only get the optimal crew id based on the example jsons provided in the github page. 

    To make way for more tests, we can modify the "crewInfo" and "orderInfo" in the getOptimalCrew" function. The reason for doing this is that there is no mention of data source in the question in the github page.

    How to run the main script:
        - yarn start

    How to run the test script:
        - yarn test
